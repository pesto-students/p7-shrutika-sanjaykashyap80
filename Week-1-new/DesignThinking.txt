Starting with problem in the given first of all we will try to empathize the problem and then we will proceed furthur.
Let's talk to the local people around the area and try to understand the problem deeply. From here we will find out different different problems related to the roads.
Now after understanding the problems related to the road we will define the problems properly because if we will be having the right problem statement then only we can proceed to the right solutions. In many cases the biggest challenge is to figure out the right problem.
Let's create two two way roads intersecting each other then will decide further things. So here we design the roads in the way so that strollers and wheelchairs can commute easily so for this we will have to create a pedestrain besides the roads.
So after doing all the above things we will add the traffic lights and zebra crossing as well and we will have to decide different different time frames for different kinds of vehicals like for heavy vehicles can run only in night time when normal public travel less and different different part of raods for different types of vehicle like heavy vehicles can only run in the right side of the roads of a road.
So after doing all now come to the prototype let's create different types of protype and figure out which is the best suitable according to our requirements.
And after creating the prototypes comes to the testing here because this is the road we can't create a prototype which is usable ny public so we will have to figure out the some manuall testing and theoritical testing methods. After getting passed through our all the testing if there is any scarcity of anything then we will start working on that and so on. and after getting the proper result we are ready for the implementation of the actual product.
